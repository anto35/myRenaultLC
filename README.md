# myRenaultLC
 Standalone browser page to access Renault vehicles data
 
Available here: http://jumpjack.altervista.org/myrenault
 

Fill in your MyRenault credentials (email and password), then select the endpoint from the list, and click QUERY button. Some endpoints have two versions available, depending on your car: try both; if the endpoint exists, you'll see the output in the output panel, else you'll see a "404" error if endpoint does not exists, or other numbers if you missed some additional parameters in the endpoint.

Security warning
----------------

If you don't want to fill-in your credentials in an unknown page, download the page to your PC: you will get an index.html file and many .js files into same folder. Just open index.html in your favourite browser and start testing.

Since version 2.4.0 the web page uses a php script ( https://github.com/jumpjack/myRenaultLC/blob/main/gigya-login.php ) located in its own folder to perform authentication on Gigya server; the user can use the script he prefers, as long as it returns this structure:


	{
		"loginData" : {
			"cookie" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" ,
			"JWT" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
			"personId" : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
		}
	}

Syntax for calling the script:

    /gigya-login.php?gigyakey=XXXXXXXXX&gigyasite=XXXXXXXX&kamereon=XXXXXXXX&username=XXXXXXXXX&password=XXXXXXXX
